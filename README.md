### Hello! üê¶
I am a localized bird who does random things on GitHub to try and improve own skills one at a time, and i mainly contribute to other projects if i feel like it.

- üî≠ I am a official moderator for [ViaVersion](https://discord.gg/viaversion) but also have a strong relationship with [Fabulously Optimized](https://discord.gg/yxaXtaQqdB) modpack,
- üêß I [daily-drive linux](https://kubuntu.org) on both my computer and my laptop because i am satisified with it and don't need a ridiculous windows desktop experience,
- üíª I own and maintain both [MCWine](https://github.com/Kichura/MCWine) and [Minecraft on ARM](https://github.com/Kichura/Minecraft_ARM) as those are my main things to focus on, *(despite the messy additions)*
- üó∫Ô∏è I like to do vacations pretty often in my spare time because i oftenly eat pizza outside and prefer to go out swimming with my personal friends IRL.
