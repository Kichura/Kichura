### Hello! 🐦
I am a localized bird who does random things on GitHub to try and improve own skills one at a time, and i mainly contribute to other projects if i feel like it.

- 🔭 I am a official moderator for [ViaVersion](https://github.com/ViaVersion) but also have a strong relationship with [Fabulously Optimized](https://discord.gg/yxaXtaQqdB) modpack,
- 🐧 I [daily-drive linux](https://kubuntu.org) on both my computer and my laptop because i am satisified with it and don't need a ridiculous windows desktop experience,
- 💻 I own and maintain both [MCWine](https://github.com/Kichura/MCWine) and [Minecraft on ARM](https://github.com/Kichura/Minecraft_ARM) projects as those are my main things to focus on. *(despite the messy additions)*

<sub><sup><sup>stole this readme from [kennytv](https://github.com/kennytv) just to make my own one out of it. hehe!</sub></sup></sup>
