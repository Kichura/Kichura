### Hello! 🐦
I am a localized bird who does random things on GitHub to try and improve my own skills one at a time, and i mainly contribute to other projects if i feel like it.

- 🔭 I am a official moderator for [ViaVersion](https://github.com/ViaVersion) but also have a strong relationship with the [Fabulously Optimized](https://discord.gg/yxaXtaQqdB) modpack,
- 🐧 I [daily-drive linux](https://kubuntu.org) on both my tower machine and my laptop because i am satisified with it and don't need a ridiculous windows desktop experience,
- 💻 I own and maintain both the [MCWine](https://github.com/Kichura/MCWine) project and the [Minecraft on ARM](https://github.com/Kichura/Minecraft_ARM) project as those are my main things to focus on. *(despite the messy additions)*
